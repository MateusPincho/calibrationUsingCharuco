# Calibration Using Charuco board
**Still in progress!!** 

Camera calibration consists in obtaining the camera intrinsic parameters and distortion coefficients. This parameters remain fixed unless the camera optic is modified, thus camera calibration only need to be done once.

Calibrating using ArUco is much more versatile than using traditional chessboard patterns, since it allows occlusions or partial views.

You can see all the process in **calibUsingCharuco.ipynb**, follow the instructions in the notebook

The images used for the calibration are in **patternImages** folder
